## General Info
Rapunzel is a simple C++ game based on Timber!, which is the first lesson in Beginning C++ Game Programming, 2nd Ed. by John Horton. Timber is, in turn, based on Timberman on Steam.
Rapunzel requires the 32-bit versions of SFML 2.6.2 and the corresponding GCC 13.1.0 mingw. I configured my environment in CodeBlocks, but John Horton recommends using Visual Studio Code.
I changed the game from a Timber clone with a lumberjack chopping down a tree and avoiding the branches to a wizard attacking a tower with a staff and avoiding Rapunzel's braids.
